        <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Carter Do, I am a Computer Science major. I am currently in my third year of college. I also enjoy learning about new technologies and programming languages.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to watch anime, play video games, and hang out with my friends. My favorite video game of all time is League of Legends.</p>
        <p>I also have a passion for food! I love trying out new restaurants and cuisines. Some of my favorite foods include sushi, pho, and Korean BBQ.</p>
        <p>One of my core values is sleeping. I believe that after a long and hard day of doing work, a nice rest is always needed.</p>
