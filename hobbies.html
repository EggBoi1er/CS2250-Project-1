                <li><strong>My First First Love</strong> - I like this show because it is a very wholesome show about an initial friendship that blossoms into something more. Also its pacing is very nice.</li>
                <li><strong>Twenty-Five Twenty-One</strong> - I like this show because it has a good mix of romance, drama, and sports. I wasn't interested in fencing until I watched this show but now it has me hooked.</li>
